# Web-App-Scanner
A simple script written to scan web apps

This script uses the requests module to send an API request to a vulnerability scanner to start a scan on the target web application. The script sets the target URL, API endpoint, and API key, and sends a POST request with the necessary headers and data. The script then checks the status code of the response to determine if the scan was started successfully or if there was an error.

To use the script, you will need to replace the placeholder values (e.g. example.com, scanner.example.com, your_api_key) with the appropriate values for your web application and vulnerability scanner. You will also need to modify the script to handle the results of the scan, such as printing the vulnerabilities found or saving them to a file.
